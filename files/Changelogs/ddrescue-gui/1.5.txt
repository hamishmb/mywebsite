DDRescue-GUI 1.5:
Changes since v1.4:

  * Use Cocoa Dialog (http://mstratman.github.io/cocoadialog/#) to add notifications on OS X, because it works from 10.4 onwards.

  * Add LC_ALL=C when calling lshw (GetDevInfo package), so make it work when the system language isn't English.

  * Always call parted with the "-s" flag so it never waits for user input in weird situations, making mounting output files more robust.

  * Use a thread to keep track of elapsed time because the wx.Timer seems unreliable on OS X.

  * Enable the log file option on OS X (for some reason it's just working now!).

  * Rewrite the OS X portion of the GetDevInfo package to use plists (Property Lists) because it's faster, easier and more reliable.

  * Get direct disk access working on Parted Magic (get physical block size instead of logical block size in GetDevInfo package).

  * FIx relatively unimportant GUI formatting issues when using ddrescue v1.20.

  * Enable Reverse option on OS X (give ddrescue disk size cos it can't calculate it).

  * Detach images when mounting fails on OS X, allowing the user to try again in some circumstances.

  * Fix crash when resizing main window during recovery (wxpython 3.x, Linux only).

  * Get \r (carriage return) and \x1b[a (up one line) working in the output box, so ddrescue's output is now displayed exactly the same as when run from a terminal.

  * Fix high CPU Usage on OS X.

  * Fix memory leak on OS X.

  * Fix big delay before first GUI update on OS X.

  * Build ddrescue v1.20 fat binary (32-bit and 64-bit) for OS X.

  * Get Reverse and Preallocate working again on OS X.

  * Make output box work like a terminal on OS X.

  * Fix detecting of complete recovery with all data on OS X.

  * Make SettingsWindow remember settings if the user navigates back to it later.

  * Stop the user from changing the insertion point in the output box and messing up the formatting by accident.

  * If ddrescue won't exit, prompt user to wait or try again rather than waiting indefinitely until it stops.

  * Don't let the user save outputfile, logfile to /root on Parted Magic because the lack of space will cause the recovery to stop quickly.

  * Fix elapsed time counter.

  * Make sure to destroy dialogs after using them to free up memory.

  * Fix a few last-minute bugs with the settings window.
