Wine Autostart (0.9):

  * More comments added to code.
  * Use unset, not <var>="".
  * Use sed, not tr.
  * Use custom gksudo messages.
  * Created wineautostarterror to handle errors.
  * Stop creating files in /tmp.
  * Use "wine start /Unix <path>", not "wine <path>". This fixes various uninteresting problems with wine crashing. (Thanks Daniel Curtis)
  * Use "grep .exe" instead of "grep open=", and use more intelligent sed commands to get the correct exe file.
