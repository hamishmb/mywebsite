Wine Autostart (2.0.2):

  * Fix a bug in the autorun.inf parser.
  * Use wx.TextCtrl.LoadFile() where possible.
  * Always call panels self.Panel.
  * Don't use the name "Wine Autoscan" in the GUI because it sounds like a different product.
  * Make sure dialogue boxes and windows are on top and visible to the user.
  * Use os.walk() instead of find for searching CDs.
  * Fix exporting config on first run.
  * Pull in new GetDevInfo package from WxFixBoot.
  * Save config for each user (in home dir) for greater customisation.
  * Save StartOnBoot settings for each user as well.
  * Put Python version into logfile on startup.
