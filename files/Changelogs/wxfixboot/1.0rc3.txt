WxFixBoot (1.0~rc3):

  * Various UI code fixes and improvements
  * Various fixes to thread code and background scripts, making wxfixboot more stable and able to handle and avoid more errors.
  * The OnCheckBox() method of MainWindow() has been split into a manager method (to insure the checkboxes don't allow dangerous options), still called OnCheckBox(), and a save method called SaveMainOptions(). This has an enormous list of advantages, to many to list here. It includes the ability to remember the settings after looking at options windows, and the code is now MUCH easier to read!
  * Fixes and additions to startup scripts, including
  * Enable showing which dependencies are missing, if any are,
  * Handle junk in command output more effectively, avoiding errors,
  * Increase speed in some cases.
  * Output Box included,
  * Now outputbox with normal terminal-like colour scheme (white text on a black background).
  * Progress bars for operations screen semi-operational.
  * Now includes test for the outputbox and status messages.
  * Outputbox now works with openbox.
  * It now handles grub legacy better (but won't reinstall or update it).
  * Non-device entries are now removed in RootFS selections.
  * Tons of important fixes and improvements in GUI code, including
  * Newly arranged Options dlg,
  * Patched firmware dialog, with better handling of GRUB Legacy, and it now respondes the same way when updating the bootloader as when it reinstalls it.
  * Improved Options dlg, which can now recall previous settings and update itself with that info,
  * New Restore bootsector dialog,
  * New restore partition table dialog.
  * New OutputBox manager thread, fully and inteligently programmed to update the output box reliably and quickly without duplicating or missing lines of output.
  * Logger is now operational, and text to log is now entered.
  * Now includes cmdline options for debug and verbose logging.
  * The startup scripts no longer print to the terminal, instead their output is logged in debug mode.
  * All GUI work is now finished.
