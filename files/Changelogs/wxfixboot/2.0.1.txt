WxFixBoot (2.0.1):
  * Changes since v2.0:

  * Interpret all cmdline input as UTF-8.
  * Try harder to get the correct LV filesystem paths.
  * Fix a bug related to the above.
  * Get all of the aliases for LVM disks in GetDevInfo.
  * Use Aliases to avoid confusion over which OS is the default one.
  * Tell user how to hide the boot menu if there's just 1 OS detected.
  * Enable support for hiding the boot menu.
  * Fix RootFS detection on Ubuntu installations that use LVM.
  * Display the above boot menu message more nicely.
  * If we can't get the OS name with the python script, use lsb_release -sd if possible (fixes detection on eg Devuan).
  * Attempt to veto shutdowns during operations.
  * Wait until the package manager isn't busy, rather than failing if it is.
  * Add the unit tests from DDRescue-GUI.
  * Write unit tests for GetDevInfo.
  * Sort of port BackendToolsTests from DDRescue-GUI to CoreTools.
  * Fix GetCapacityTest.
  * Fix Misc GetDevInfo stuff.
  * Fix CoreTools tests.
  * Write test for CoreTools.GetPartitionMountedAt().
  * Write DlgTools tests.

  * Write test for WaitUntilPackageManagerNotInUse().
  * Write test for FindMissingFSCKModules().
  * Write test for FindCheckableFileSystems().
  * Write test for HandleFileSystemCheckReturnValues().
  * Separate the tests into subpackages.
  * Make a file to hold special dialog tools used during the tests.
  * Use the above in CoreToolsTests and DialogToolsTests.
  * Use it in HelperBackendToolsTests, and EssentialBackendToolsTests.
  * Stop dialogs from getting in the way during tests (use wx.Yield() to process events to close them).
  * Make test for DeterminePackageManager.
  * Make test for GetFSTabInfo.
  * Make test for DetermineOSArch.
  * Make test for GetOSNameWithLSB.
  * Write tests for AskForOSName.

  * Fix GetOSs test.
  * Always specify a parent when displaying dialogs during unit tests to avoid weird/random errors.

  * Fix GetDevInfo tests on Fedora.
  * Test the unit tests on Fedora (all supported versions).
  * Test the unit tests on Parted Magic.
  * Fix checking if there is 1 or more Linux OS (OS X and Windows were being counted too, causing problems later).

  * Fix incorrect LV/VG names.
  * Fix the default OS getter and setter.
