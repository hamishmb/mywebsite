                GNU ddrescue is a data recovery program, written by Antonio Diaz Diaz. It's amazingly powerful, and has a lot of features other tools don't have, such as the ability to use a recovery mapfile (previously called a log file), which means that if your system crashes during a recovery, you can start again where you left off. DDRescue-GUI currently calls this a log file, but it will be changed to mapfile in a future release.
            </p><p>
                Other features include multiple passes over drives to try and get the easy-to-read data first, direct disk access (complicated so I will explain it later), and disk-to-disk recovery. It was originally written for Linux, ddrescue can actually run just fine on macOS and even Windows, which makes it all the more impressive. Note that DDRescue-GUI doesn't currently run on Windows, but may do so in a later release.
            </p><p>
                That's where the difficulty comes in, though. Firstly, ddrescue is a command-line tool, which means only people who are used to using the text-only command-line are going to be able to use it. It's possible to figure it out anyway, but if you're not confident that you're doing it right you could cause loss of data. Despite this, ddrescue is probably still the best data recovery tool out there.
            </p><p>
                The second problem is that while ddrescue will run on macOS, you have to compile it, which is often slow, difficult, and confusing, especially if you aren't used to doing this sort of thing. DDRescue-GUI provides a graphical interface for ddrescue, and solves some of these other problems as well.

                Nevertheless, remember that GNU ddrescue is an excellent tool. For more information about ddrescue, see <a class="link" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/" target="_top">https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/</a>.
